# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of errors originating from asynchronous operations.  When an asynchronous function (like a database query or external API call) throws an error, the Express.js server might fail silently, without sending a proper error response to the client, making debugging and user experience challenging.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code. The `bugSolution.js` shows how to fix the error using appropriate error handling middleware and more robust asynchronous error management techniques.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js
3. Run `node bug.js`
4. Observe that error may happen silently. Sometimes 'Hello' will show up.
